# 2 mechanisms for Web Storage
sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.


# use for shopping cart persistance
localStorage.getItem
localStorage.setItem
