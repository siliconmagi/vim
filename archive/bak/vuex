# vuex format
1) store: shared state, injected into components
2) actions: components call actions to mutate state
3) mutations: perform state mutation, 

# note
1) actions can compose 1+ mutations or perform logic to determine which mutation to call.
2) business logic should not be in components but instead in the store
3) when state is updated, any component with a getter, computed property, or other mapping to the store will be instantly up-to-date
